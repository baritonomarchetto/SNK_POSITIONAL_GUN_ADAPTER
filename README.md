# SNK_POSITIONAL_GUN_ADAPTER
Gun shooter games deserve a soft spot in any '80s - '90s kid's heart. Not only arcade games like Taito's Operation Wolf or it's successor contributed to this, but also game consoles like the Nintendo NES and his seminal Zapper light gun games (Duck Hunt, Wild Gunman, Hogan's Alley) and, why not, the Playstation one's GunCon/G-Con by Namco or Konami's Justifier/Hyperblaster.

Years have passed and monitors technology has radically changed with CRTs passing away to leave the floor to LEDs. This, unfortunately, made playing shooter games with appropriate hardware more difficult.

Althought commonly referred to as "light gun" games, not all the games adopting "guns" were optical in nature. Optical technology (or rather "technologies") was accompanied by another technology which was based on two simple potentiometers, one for each picture axis. These were called "positional guns" and, at a basic level, could be considered equivalent to a gamepad with a single analog thumbstick.

Positional guns were easier to implement and, most important for us, their working principle was independent on the monitor technology!

In this repo all the files I developed for the project.
